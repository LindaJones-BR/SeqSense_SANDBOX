        <p class="Body_0">The stderr command prompts the <MadCap:variable name="Product Variables.Long Product Name" /> to output its status while running. The Toolkit also writes to a log file (.nextflow.log) in the directory that is mounted to /work. This log file captures the steps run and the command line options set.</p>
