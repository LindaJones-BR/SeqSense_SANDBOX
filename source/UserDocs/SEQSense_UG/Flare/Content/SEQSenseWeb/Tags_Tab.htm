        <p class="Body_0">Tags are simple pieces of descriptive data applied to your sequencing sample files, which provide details about an item and facilitate locating related items with the same tag. </p>
        <p class="Body_0">Tags are used to capture various pieces of metadata, such as project name, experiment name, variables, methods, and so forth.  You can also group and sort your sample file records based on these tags in lieu of folders.</p>
        <p class="Body_0">From the Tags tab, you can view your existing tags, and associate tags with your sample file records.</p>
